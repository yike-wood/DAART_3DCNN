# DAART_3DCNN

This is the code for the paper Feasibility of planning-CT-free rapid workflow for stereotactic body radiotherapy: removing the need for planning CT by AI-driven, intelligent prediction of body deformation.

- Task: dCT -> pCT
- Model architecture: 3D CNN
- Result: the difference of RASSDs, DSCs, and HD between (rCT-vs-pCT) and (sCT-vs-pCT) were 6 HU, 0.02 and 0.3 mm, respectively.
